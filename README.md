# Hydra-Chat

This is the my latest iteration of all the features I want in Twitch's chat. 

## Use Cases

1. *Join a couple* of popular channels and watch the messages and memes flood the room.

2. *join a bunch* of small, comfy streams you frequent and never miss a message.

## Features

* Join multiple channels
* Colored messages based on channel
* Fast and lightweight
* Has desktop and mobile resolutions
* Fast channel switching (use UpArrow and DownArrow)
* Highlight and focus on current channel
* Set Messages to colorless
