# Hydra-Chat

This is the my 3rd and latest iteration of all the features I only want and need in Twitch's chat. 

## Use Cases

1. *Join a couple* of popular channels and watch the messages and memes flood the room 

2. *join a bunch* of small, comfy streams you frequent and never miss a message.

## Features

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
